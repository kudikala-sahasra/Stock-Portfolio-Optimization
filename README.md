## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded historical data from Yahoo Finance covering the years 2014 to 2024.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculated annual and log-returns for selected stocks.
   - Analyzed volatility, skewness, and kurtosis.
   - Used the Sharpe Ratio to assess risk-adjusted returns.
3. **Financial Models and Techniques**:
   - **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)**: Used to estimate the expected return of assets based on their risk relative to the market.
   - **GARCH Model**: Used to simulate volatility.
   - **ARIMA Model**: Applied to understand the patterns and behaviors in stock prices over time.
   - **Risk Management**: Evaluated using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
   - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Used to simulate and analyze the risk and return profiles of investment portfolios.

## Project Components
1. **Portfolio Optimization**: Constructed and optimized portfolios based on historical performance and risk metrics.
2. **Risk Management**: Assessed and managed the risk associated with the investment portfolios using advanced risk measurement techniques.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzed stock price movements and trends over time to inform investment decisions.

## Results
The analysis demonstrated significant improvements in portfolio performance through the application of advanced financial models and data analysis techniques. The optimized portfolio, consisting of stocks from various industries such as AMZN, MDT, PEP, JPM, and LMT, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark.

The Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the optimized portfolio achieved an average annual return of 20.91%, with a volatility of 18.32% and a Sharpe Ratio of 1.1410. In comparison, the S&P 500 (SPY) showed an annual return of 14.25%, with a volatility of 17.52% and a Sharpe Ratio of 0.8135.

These results highlight the effectiveness of the financial models used in this project, particularly in risk management and return optimization. The higher Sharpe Ratio of the optimized portfolio indicates a better risk-adjusted return compared to the S&P 500, showcasing the potential for enhanced investment performance through data-driven portfolio optimization.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of financial models and data analysis in creating optimized investment portfolios, providing valuable insights for achieving superior returns. The integration of sophisticated financial models and Python programming demonstrates the potential for developing robust investment strategies that can outperform traditional market benchmarks.
